    "Given an array of integers, write a function to move all zeros to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "the output will be [6, 5, 3, 3, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0].\n",

    "\n",
    "the maximum product of two integers in the array would be 48, which is achieved by multiplying 8 and 6."
